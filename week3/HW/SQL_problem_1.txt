Part 1

I first constructed a table with these observations:
- 5
- 10
- 15
- 20
- 25
- NULL

If I were to look at this table, I would go ahead and average the observations that are not NULL. I am not including NULL's in my calculations as I am not considering that an observation that has impact on the overall analysis.

After doing my calculations, I get an average of 15. This is because I added the 5 numbers up together and then divided it by 5 (the number of observations that were added together).

When comparing it to my temp SQL table, I also get an average of 15. From this, I can conclude that AVG function does not take into consideration the NULL observations and ignores them in the calculation.

Part 2
Running this line:
```
SELECT SUM(Count)/COUNT(*) FROM table1;
```
I get an answer of 12.5. But running the next line:
```
SELECT SUM(Count)/COUNT(Count) FROM table1;
```
I get an answer of 15.

From this, the second line is correct. This is because both the SUM and COUNT function takes into account observations that are not NULL.
Because these functions are used both in the numerator and denominator, we are specifying that we want a complete count of observations, since it ignores the NULL observations.
